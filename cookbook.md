## Party Hedgehog - Mettigel - Raw Pork Hedgehog

### Ingredients
 - 2 pounds ground pork, or pork roast
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
 - 1 to 2 onions
 - Olives, for garnish
 - Bread, or rolls, for serving

### Steps

1.  You may choose to grind your pork yourself, to ensure its freshness. Buy a roast and trim it of most of the fat. Place the pieces in the freezer for about one hour, or until they are firm to the touch but not frozen solid.

2.  Use the large grinding plate and pre-cool all parts of the grinder.

3.  Grind the meat without adding any ice. Keep the collecting bowl chilled. Season meat lightly with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper. Some people like garlic or caraway in their raw pork, too.

4.  Make one larger, rounded shape and one smaller, oval shape and place side by side on a platter.

5.  Form the smaller oval into a pointed face.

6.  Cut the onion lengthwise into slivers. Start from the tail end and stick pieces of onion into the meat, poking out. Create rows (check picture for details).

7.  Decorate the head with olives for eyes and nose. Use toothpicks if necessary.

8.  Keep chilled during entire party (on a bed of ice, for instance) and serve with bread or rolls, more onion and mustard (non-standard).
